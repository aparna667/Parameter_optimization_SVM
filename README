Overview
This is a machine learning script written in Python using the scikit-learn library to perform classification on the "letter-recognition" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The script uses the NuSVC algorithm to train a model and find the best hyperparameters for each sample in the dataset.

Dataset
The "letter-recognition" dataset contains 20,000 samples of 26 capital letters in the English alphabet. Each sample is represented by 16 attributes that describe the shape and style of the letter, and a target variable indicating the corresponding letter.
